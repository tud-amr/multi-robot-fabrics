## Other Dependencies
Below you find instructions for installing dependencies (optionally) required.

### Poetry 
Poetry is a Python packaging and dependency management tool. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. We advise you to use this tool to install all required dependencies. However, it is not a requirement and a simple pip install for all dependencies will work as well. 

For more information, we refer to the [poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
